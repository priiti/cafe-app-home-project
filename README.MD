# HKI_5002 HOME_PROJECT
## Cafe webpage ‚òï

Tested to build a website using Node and Express framework for the backend. Main idea of the website was to create a one website for cafes in Haapsalu. Regular users can sign- up and write reviews with ratings to existing cafes. Cafe owner users can add their cafe and manage the information as well adding a photo about the cafe. Also some permissions are used as who can add cafe or not. Also who can write review and etc. Admin user is also capable of managing the whole site as giving user permissions, deleting or editing stuff etc. Many things still in TODO list.
